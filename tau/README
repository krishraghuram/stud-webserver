Tau Readme

We are trying to emulate a filesystem using a relational database
Thus, we must first understand the structure of a filesystem

Filesystem is a tree structure, where data is organized into "folders" and "files"
Example :
FilesystemRoot
├── Folder1
│   ├── Folder1
│   └── Folder2
├── Folder2
│   ├── Folder1
│   ├── Folder2
│   ├── Folder3
│   └── Folder4
└── Folder3
    ├── File1
    ├── File2
    └── File3
The difference between folders and files is that, a folder can occur anywhere in the tree, but files can only occur at leaf-positions

Models
	Drive
	Folder
	File

In tau, to emulate folder hierarchy in mysql, we simplify our understanding as follows. 
1) Every folder has a parent folder.
2) EVery file has a parent folder
Note : The FilesystemRoot is the only folder without a parent

Filesystem Operations :
In a filesystem, we can
1) Create a folder inside another folder
2) Create a file inside a folder
3) Change the name of a folder, keeping its contents intact
4) Change the name of a file
5) Change a file(Same as deleting a file and adding a new file)
6) Delete a folder, including all its contents
7) Delete a file

In tau, to emulate these operations, we use python and django
